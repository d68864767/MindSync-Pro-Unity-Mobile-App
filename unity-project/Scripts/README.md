# Scripts

This directory contains the C# scripts for implementing various functionalities in the MindSync Pro Unity Mobile App.

## Contents

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the scripts directory.
- `CognitiveWorkout.cs`: A script for implementing a 5-minute cognitive workout.
- [List any other scripts in the directory]

## Usage

The scripts in this directory are responsible for implementing different features and functionalities of the MindSync Pro app. Here is a brief description of the included script:

- `CognitiveWorkout.cs`: This script provides the logic for starting a 5-minute cognitive workout. It can be attached to a game object in the Unity scene and called when the workout needs to be initiated.

## Examples

Here is an example of how the `CognitiveWorkout.cs` script can be used:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class CognitiveWorkout : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void StartWorkout()
    {
        // Implement the cognitive workout logic here
        Debug.Log("MindSync Pro workout started!");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `StartWorkout` method is called to initiate the cognitive workout. You can customize the logic inside the method to provide the desired workout experience.
