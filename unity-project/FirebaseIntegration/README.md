## Usage

The Firebase integration in this directory allows the MindSync Pro app to utilize Firebase services for user authentication, cloud storage, and real-time analytics. Here is a brief description of the included scripts:

- `FirebaseConfig.cs`: This script is responsible for configuring Firebase settings, such as API keys and project IDs.
- `FirebaseAuth.cs`: This script handles user authentication using Firebase, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their credentials.
- `FirebaseStorage.cs`: This script provides functions for managing cloud storage using Firebase, allowing users to upload and download files.
- `FirebaseAnalytics.cs`: This script tracks user progress using Firebase analytics, collecting data on user interactions and performance.
- `FirebaseProgressTracking.cs`: This script visualizes user progress using Firebase real-time analytics, displaying charts and graphs based on collected data.
- `FirebaseDependencies.cs`: This script manages Firebase dependencies, ensuring that the required libraries and plugins are properly installed.

To use Firebase integration in the MindSync Pro app, follow these steps:

1. Set up a Firebase project and obtain the necessary API keys and project IDs.
2. Configure Firebase settings in the `FirebaseConfig.cs` script.
3. Use the `FirebaseAuth.cs` script to handle user authentication.
4. Use the `FirebaseStorage.cs` script to manage cloud storage.
5. Use the `FirebaseAnalytics.cs` script to track user progress.
6. Use the `FirebaseProgressTracking.cs` script to visualize user progress.
7. Ensure that all required Firebase dependencies are properly installed using the `FirebaseDependencies.cs` script.
